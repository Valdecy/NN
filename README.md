# Neural Network Function

Neural Network Function for Binary or Linear Output. The function returns the final weigths, the hidden layers activation function and the output activation function

* Trainning: Full Batch
* Activation Functions: sigmoid, tanh,  identity, relu and gaussian
* Output Activation Functions: sigmoid, tanh,  identity, relu and gaussian
* Layers: List with the number of hidden layers and quantity of neurons. Ex: layers[0] = Perceptron, layers[1,7] = Two hidden layers, the first one with 1 neuron and the second one with 7 neurons.
* For the Binary Output case a confusion matrix table and a loss function graph is provided.
* For the Linear Output case a loss function graph is provided.
